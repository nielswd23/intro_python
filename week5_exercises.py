### Some suggestions ###

## Question 1 ##
# Reading contents from a bunch of files in a folder and transforming the 
# data in some way. 
# Maybe some string manipulations like using split and then 
# counting words. Maybe want to be stripping off some other corpus 
# annotation stuff 


## Question 2 ##
# With CSVs, read in a bunch of data files with DictReader and extract
# some info


## Question 3 ##
# Some exercise with argparse where we can pass in any file and get some 
# desired output. Can be simple like reading a text file and returning a 
# dictionary of words and counts. 
# Force them to use the __name__ == "__main__" syntax by saying we must be
# able to import the functions to another python script
