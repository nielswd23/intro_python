### Some suggestions ###

## Question 1 ##
# Can import a big csv with a lot of probabilities and convert them to 
# log probs. But there will be a lot of exceptions they need to handle


## Question 2 ##
# Give them some code that is a little complicated and has a lot of different 
# errors types. 
# Can have a short answer question asking them what the contents of certain 
# objects are at different stages of the script running
